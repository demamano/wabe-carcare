Mastering Microservices: A Hands-On Tutorial with Node.js, RabbitMQ, Nginx, and Docker
Microservices architecture is a smart way to design applications by breaking them into smaller, independent components—microservices—each focusing on a specific task. These microservices operate autonomously, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling. This flexibility enables developers to tweak or update specific components without overhauling the entire application. This is in stark contrast to traditional monolithic architecture, where the whole application is treated as one indivisible unit, often leading to inflexibility and scalability issues.

Before diving into this tutorial, if you find microservices mysterious, check out my previous article for a detailed explanation. In this hands-on tutorial, we'll build a real-time chat server using Node.js, Socket.io, RabbitMQ, and Docker. Get ready for a practical journey into the world of microservices! Let's begin.

Prerequisites
Before getting into the development process, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine and ready:

1. Node.js and npm

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download them from the Node.js official website.

# Check Node.js and npm are installed correctly
node -v
npm -v
2. TypeScript

As we'll be using TypeScript for enhanced development, install it globally using npm.

# Install TypeScript globally
npm install -g typescript

# Check TypeScript version
tsc -v
3. Docker

Docker will be used for containerization. Download and install Docker from Docker's official website.

4. MongoDB

Ensure you have MongoDB installed for data storage. You can download MongoDB Community Server from MongoDB's official website or use the cloud cluster.

5. Nginx

For setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy, you can follow the installation instructions on Nginx's official documentation.

6. Postman (Optional)

To test the API endpoints, you can use Postman. Download and install Postman from Postman's official website.

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you'll be ready to proceed with setting up and developing our microservices-based chat server. Let's move on to the next steps!
